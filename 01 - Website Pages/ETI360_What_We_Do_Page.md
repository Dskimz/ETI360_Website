# What we do

ETI360 works with schools to support the preparation, review, and documentation of school-sponsored travel decisions.

Our services are delivered through a **collaborative, expert-led decision-support model**. We do not provide self-serve tools or automated decision-making. We work alongside school leadership to prepare materials that are ready for thoughtful review.

## Supporting school-sponsored travel decisions

ETI360 supports a wide range of school-sponsored travel, from single-day field trips to complex, multi-day international programs.

Across all contexts, our role is consistent:
- Improve clarity before leadership review  
- Support expert preparation and documentation  
- Strengthen decision-making without assuming authority

## Preparing trips for leadership review

ETI360 supports schools by preparing trips for review and discussion.

This work includes:
- Creating **structured, consistently formatted itineraries** that clearly show what students will be doing  
- Organizing activities, locations, transportation, and schedules into a coherent picture of the trip  
- Ensuring supporting materials are complete and ready for review  

The goal is to ensure leadership is reviewing well-prepared information, not assembling it.

## Expert review and documentation

ETI360’s educational travel experts review materials to ensure they are ready for leadership consideration.

This includes:
- Coordinating with schools and trip providers to clarify details  
- Reviewing activity-level documentation for completeness and relevance  
- Preparing **decision-ready documentation** that supports focused discussion  

This review supports decision-making. It does not replace leadership judgment.

## Emergency action and response planning documentation

As part of trip preparation, ETI360 supports the documentation of emergency action and response planning.

This ensures that:
- Preparedness considerations are explicit  
- Response planning is reviewed in context  
- Leadership understands how contingencies have been considered  

The emphasis is on documentation and clarity, not guarantees.

## Governance and accountability support

ETI360 supports governance by helping schools maintain clear documentation of how travel decisions are prepared and reviewed.

This includes:
- Traceability from inputs to final documentation  
- Materials suitable for leadership, board, or committee review  
- Records that support accountability without shifting responsibility  

Decisions remain with school leadership. ETI360 supports the preparation that leads up to them.
