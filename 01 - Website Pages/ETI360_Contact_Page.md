# Contact

Starting with a conversation helps determine whether ETI360’s approach is the right fit for your school.

We use initial conversations to understand context, expectations, and review needs—not to demonstrate software or push predefined solutions.

## What to expect (and how to prepare)

A first conversation is structured and practical, and you do not need to prepare materials in advance.

We typically discuss:
- Your school’s travel program and decision context  
- How trips are currently prepared and reviewed  
- Where clarity, consistency, or documentation may be difficult  
- Whether ETI360’s expert-led decision-support model applies  

There is no obligation or commitment required to have this conversation.

## Next steps

If there is alignment, we can discuss:
- Scope and engagement approach  
- How ETI360 would support preparation and review  
- What decision-ready outputs would look like in your context  

If there is not a clear fit, the conversation still provides useful perspective.
