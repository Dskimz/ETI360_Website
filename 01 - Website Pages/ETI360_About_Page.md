# About ETI360

ETI360 exists to support better decision-making around school-sponsored travel.

We work with schools to improve how travel decisions are prepared, reviewed, and documented—so leadership teams can act with clarity, confidence, and accountability.

## Why ETI360 exists

School-sponsored travel plays an important role in education, but preparing these decisions well is complex.

Travel programs often involve:
- Multiple providers and partners  
- Varying levels of documentation  
- Tight review timelines  
- High expectations for oversight and accountability  

ETI360 was created to address this preparation gap. Our focus is not on managing trips or making decisions, but on ensuring that leadership is reviewing clear, consistent, and defensible information.

## Our philosophy

ETI360 is grounded in a simple principle: **better preparation leads to better decisions**.

We believe:
- Decisions should be informed by clear, well-structured information  
- Expert review improves the quality of materials under consideration  
- Documentation matters—for review, accountability, and learning  
- Responsibility for decisions should remain clear and explicit  

Our role is to support schools by strengthening preparation and review, not by shifting authority or judgment.

## How we work

ETI360 operates through a collaborative, expert-led decision-support model.

We:
- Work alongside school leadership and administrators  
- Prepare and review materials with care and discipline  
- Use systems and structure to support consistency and clarity  

This approach allows schools to benefit from expertise and structure without adopting self-serve tools or automated decision-making.

## Governance and responsibility

ETI360 is intentional about governance boundaries.

We support decision-making, but we do not approve trips, accept risk on behalf of schools, or make decisions for leadership teams.

Our work is designed to:
- Support clear review and approval processes  
- Maintain traceability from inputs to documentation  
- Reinforce accountability rather than diffuse it  

Decisions remain with school leadership. ETI360 supports the work that leads up to them.

## Who we support

ETI360 works with schools and educational organizations that sponsor travel, including:
- K–12 schools  
- International and domestic programs  
- Schools managing a range of trip types and complexities  

While each context is different, the need for clear preparation and review is consistent.

## Start a conversation

If your school is evaluating how it prepares and reviews travel decisions, a conversation is the best place to start.

We focus on understanding your context and needs before discussing whether ETI360 is the right fit.
