# TripRisk360

TripRisk360 supports ETI360’s expert-led preparation workflow by helping organize inputs into structured, review-ready outputs.

It is used to prepare materials for leadership review—not operated by schools as a self-serve platform.

## The system’s role in ETI360’s workflow

TripRisk360 supports:
- Organizing trip inputs from schools and providers into a consistent structure  
- Maintaining traceability from source materials to decision-ready documentation  
- Producing outputs that are designed to be reviewed, circulated, and referenced  

The system supports preparation and documentation discipline. Decisions remain with school leadership.

## What TripRisk360 produces

Leadership-facing outputs include:
- **Structured itineraries** suitable for leadership review and discussion  
- **Review-ready documentation sets** compiled for approval and oversight  
- **Traceable records** that support governance, accountability, and post-decision reference  

These are outputs for review—not dashboards or automated decisioning.

## Governance boundaries

TripRisk360 supports preparation, organization, and documentation.

It does not:
- Approve trips  
- Guarantee outcomes  
- Replace leadership review or judgment
