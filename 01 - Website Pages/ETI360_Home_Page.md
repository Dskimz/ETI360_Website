# ETI360

## Expert-led decision support for school-sponsored travel

ETI360 supports school leadership teams by improving how travel decisions are prepared, reviewed, and documented.

Our work focuses on **clarity before approval**—ensuring that leaders are reviewing well-prepared, consistent, and defensible materials when making decisions about school-sponsored travel.

ETI360 operates as a collaborative, expert-led decision-support model. We work with schools to prepare information for review; decisions remain with school leadership.

## Bringing clarity to complex travel plans

School-sponsored travel often involves multiple providers, varied itineraries, and large volumes of supporting documentation.

Before decisions are made, leadership teams need a clear understanding of:
- What students will be doing  
- Where activities and movements take place  
- How trips progress over time  
- What documentation supports review and oversight  

ETI360 helps bring this information into focus—before risk discussions and approvals occur.

## How ETI360 supports decision-making

ETI360’s approach centers on **structured preparation and expert review**.

We help schools by:
- Creating **structured, consistently formatted itineraries** that make trips easy to understand  
- Preparing **decision-ready documentation** reviewed by educational travel experts  
- Documenting **emergency action and response planning** alongside trip materials  
- Supporting **governance traceability and accountability** through clear documentation  

The result is improved clarity at the point of leadership review.

## Built for leadership review and accountability

ETI360 is designed for environments where decisions must be reviewable, explainable, and defensible.

Materials prepared through ETI360 are suitable for:
- Leadership approval discussions  
- Internal review and oversight  
- Board or committee circulation  
- Reference after decisions are made  

The focus is on preparation and documentation—not automation, guarantees, or delegated judgment.

- Single-day field trips  
- Multi-day domestic programs  
- International travel and exchanges  

While each program is different, the preparation and review structure remains consistent.
