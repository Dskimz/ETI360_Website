# Role Brief — Senior Frontend / Systems Engineer  
**Project:** ETI360 Marketing Website & Internal Apps Support  
**Engagement:** Contract (part-time)  
**Reports to:** Founder / Product Owner

---

## Why This Role Exists
ETI360 is rebuilding its public marketing website and aligning internal applications around a clear, low‑complexity architecture.

The thinking, constraints, and decisions are already made.

This role exists to **execute cleanly**, translate decisions into production-ready code, and reduce cognitive load on the founder — not to reinvent the stack.

---

## What Success Looks Like (Very Explicit)

- Marketing website skeleton is live on Vercel
- Sanity CMS is wired, governed, and usable by marketing
- Core page templates and sections are implemented
- Responsive behavior is solved once and consistently
- The system is boring, predictable, and documented

---

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Frontend Implementation (Primary)
- Implement a Next.js (App Router) marketing site
- Build section-based pages driven by Sanity CMS
- Enforce mobile-first, responsive behavior
- Implement Tailwind CSS using provided design tokens
- Use shadcn/ui selectively

### 2. CMS Integration & Governance
- Implement Sanity schemas exactly as defined
- Enforce content constraints
- Set up previews and content publishing flow
- Ensure CMS is usable by non-technical marketing staff

### 3. Performance & Quality
- Use ISR correctly
- Ensure fast load times
- Avoid unnecessary client-side JavaScript
- Keep the marketing site unauthenticated

### 4. Collaboration
- Ask clarifying questions early
- Flag architectural conflicts immediately
- Respect constraints as intentional
- Provide concise status updates
